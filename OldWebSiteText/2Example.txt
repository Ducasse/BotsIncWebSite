An example

I would like to show you the three levels offered in this book: direct interaction with robots, scripting them and programming them. For example imagine that you want to draw a square of 100 pixels size. Watch the videos.

You can interact directly with one robot and send him messages: go: 100, turn: 90.....

You can use the Bot workspace and write

| r2d2 |
r2d2 := Bot new.
4 timesRepeat: 
     [ r2d2 go: 100.
      r2d2 turn: 90 ]
Or you can define the method square using the Code Browser

 square
  
    4 timesRepeat: 
         [ self go: 100.
          self turn: 90 ]
Then you send the message square to a robot directly or using the Bot workspace

 Bot new square
